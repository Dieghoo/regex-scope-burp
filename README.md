A tool simply for the automation of inserting domain names into regular expressions in C literrally create, as well as this README, by AI, with minor human tweaks.

C Program for Regex Pattern Matching

This program reads in a list of domain names from a text file, so that u can just send a bucnch of domain names to the same regex pattern, store it so u can use it in the future. After receiving the input and reading from the defined regex patterns to replace it generates a list of regular expression patterns based on a predefined template. The generated patterns are printed to the console.
Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you will need a C compiler installed on your system.
Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

    Save the code to a file named regexmatcher.c.

    Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing regexmatcher.c.

    Compile the program using the following command:

gcc regexmatcher.c -o regexmatcher

Run the program using the following command:

bash

    ./regexmatcher input_file

    Replace input_file with the name of the text file containing the list of domain names. The generated regular expression patterns will be printed to the console.

Customization

You can customize the regular expression pattern by modifying the REGEX_PATTERN constant in the code. The template for the pattern is _>((?:\w+\.)$abfut), which will match any subdomain of the domain specified in the input file.
